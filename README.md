find_bluetooth.py is a file used to find the address the RFDuino we were using was sending out. 
imu_bluetooth.py is the main file to run the code for the device.
scanner.py searches for all bluetooth devices that are emitting a signal nearby. This was particularly useful in debugging when the RFDuino address would stop working or potentially change.
To run any of these files, you must have PyCharm installed. To run imu_bluetooth.py, you must also have the Arduino IDE installed. Please contact owner (Maria) for help in running these.
